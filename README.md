# sensorScriptRun
Uses serial data from sensors from an Arduino uno to run Bash scripts 

Uses an arduino uno and motion sensor, but can use any sensor or arduino.
Uses Processing3 so that it can use serial data from Arduino to run bash
scripts. Arduino code written in c++, Processing3 code written in java. 
Bash scripts called vlc to play video for my example, need to enable
fullscreen mode on open for vlc. There are better ways to do this, but
when this was done all I had was an Arduino uno.
